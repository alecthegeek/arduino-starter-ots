title: Software and hardware Hacking on the Arduino

---

This is the course content for hacking with the Arduino, which has
been developed and maintained by OpenTechSchool.

# Welcome

Welcome to Hacking on the Ardunio! This course is intended to introduce
beginners some basic hardware and software hacking concepts on the Arduino
micro development board.


## What we'll do today

There are two parts to the course today. The first is the starter content. This is
so you can understand what an arduino is and how to load an Arduino program from the IDE.
The second part will teach you to prototype a simple circuit and manage it with a small
Arduino program. We will only be using the IDE for programming.

## A bit of history

The microcontroller is samll computer on a chip. As well as the central processor unit to execute
instructions it has some memory for storage and some extra circuits for things like input or output.

Using a microcontroller it is very easy to embed the intellgence of a computer program into a wide range of
devices like washing machines, cars, air conditioners and so on. Microcontrollers usually have the following
charatertics (compare this list to you laptop computer).

* Cheap: In bulk volume they only cost a few dollars
* Low power: They can be powered from a battery or telephone style charger
* Small
* Come with enough buildin circuits to make building a useful device simple and easy
* Does not come with much supporting software as the microcontroller is small and simple.

The Arduino platform was developed in Italy by taking a popular microcontroller (the AVR) and putting it on
a small cheap board with power supply and IO sockets.
The Arduino has an open source design and has become very popular which means that there are a:

* Wide range of designs to choose from (small, big, flexible) etc from a large community of manufactureres. You can even make your own.
* Lot of different add on boards (called Shields) to help with your projects

# The course

* [Setting up](core/setup.html) - Installation instructions for Windows, OSX and Linux.
* [Your first sketch](core/first-sketch.html) - Create a git repository on your laptop and share it on GitHub.
