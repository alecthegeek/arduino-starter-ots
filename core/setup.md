# Download and install the Arduino IDE

The Ardduono IDE runs on your main computer (desktop, laptop or Raspberry Pi) using Windows, OS X or Linux.
You type in your program code into the IDE, which compiles it (translates it into binary instructions) and
loads it into the Arduino.

You connect your Arduino to the IDE using the USB cable.


## Linux, Windows and Mac OS X

In order to minimise the amount of downloading please ask you course mentor for the USB stick with the software.

If you do not have access to the USB stick then you can download the software from http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.

## Windows Users

Please check carefully on the Arduino web site to see if you need to install additional drivers.


# Connect your Arduino board

Depends on the model

# Configure IDE for your board and serial connection


# Compile and download blink program
